## Workflow to resolve strains from long-read assemblies using Strainy.
### Usage

```

=================================================================================
 STRAIN RESOLUTION OF ASSEMBLIES USING STRAINY: TAPIR Pipeline version 1.0dev
=================================================================================
 The typical command for running the pipeline is as follows:
        nextflow run main.nf --reads "PathToReadFile(s)" --output_dir "PathToOutputDir" 

        Mandatory arguments:
         --reads                        Query fastqz file of sequences you wish to supply as input (e.g., "/MIGE/01_DATA/01_FASTQ/T055-8-*.fastq.gz")
         --output_dir                   Output directory (e.g., "/MIGE/01_DATA/03_ASSEMBLY")
         
        Optional arguments:
         --help                         This usage statement.
         --version                      Version statement

```


## Introduction
This pipeline attempts to resolve strains from long-read assemblies. This Nextflow pipeline was adapted from the [Strainy github page](https://github.com/katerinakazantseva/stRainy/) and the [metagenomeStrainy_ONT_pipeline github page](https://github.com/katerinakazantseva/MetagenomeStrainy_ONT_pipeline/).  
The CheckM2 database directory (has to take the name 'CheckM2_database') is expected to be present in the same directory hosting the main.nf file. Because github does not accept files of size greater than 1 GB, a typical CheckM2_database is not present in this github page. A typical CheckM2 database can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/records/5571251).

## Sample command
An example of a command to run this pipeline is:

```
nextflow run main.nf --reads "Sample_files/*.fastq.gz" --output_dir "test2" 
```


## Word of Note
This is an ongoing project at the Microbial Genome Analysis Group, Institute for Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology, Üniversitätsklinikum, Freiburg. The project is funded by BMBF, Germany, and is led by [Dr. Sandra Reuter](https://www.uniklinik-freiburg.de/institute-for-infection-prevention-and-control/microbial-genome-analysis.html).
